This is a full-scale data pipeline using Google Cloud and dbt, centered around a curated movies and entertainment domain. I sourced four primary datasets—IMDb reviews, Netflix titles, box office revenue, and movie metadata—primarily from Kaggle to represent a diverse mix of structured and semi-structured data. These were chosen to simulate realistic data integration challenges across platforms and formats. From ingestion into GCS and BigQuery to transformation using dbt models with contracts, constraints, and testing, I built an end-to-end ELT pipeline. The capstone involved using Gemini embeddings and ML.GENERATE_EMBEDDING in BigQuery for fuzzy matching movie titles—a production-ready use case that combined AI, SQL, and cloud architecture.
